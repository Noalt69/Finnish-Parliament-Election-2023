# Finnish-Parliament-Election-2023
The aim of the study is to reveal the relationship between candidates funding as well as
advertising campaign and success in political campaigns, focusing on the 2023 Finnish
parliamentary elections. We explore a critical question:
How do total funding and advertising campaigns affect the likelihood of a candidate being elected
to Finnish Parliament?
